# Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System

> You have been hired as a full stack developer at _Periodic Tables_, a startup that is creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants.
> The software is used only by restaurant personnel when a customer calls to request a reservation.
> At this point, the customers will not access the system online.

There are no user stories for deployment: it is expected that you will deploy the application to production after you finish a user story.

There are no user stories for logging: it is expected that you will add logging to the application with enough detail to help you diagnose issues in production.

# Restaurant Reservation App

## Description
For this project, I created an application for restaurants that allows users to create, update, view, and delete reservations, as well as seat them at various tables within the restaurant.

## Technologies & Tools
- [ ] React
  - [ ] React hooks
  - [ ] React router
- [ ] Node
- [ ] Postgres
- [ ] Express
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] Bootstrap4
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] RESTful APIs

## Run Locally
- [ ] Fork & Clone the repository
- [ ] Run `npm install`
- [ ] Run `npm run start: dev` to start

## env. Variables
- [ ] Backend:  DATABASE_URL, DATABASE_URL_DEVELOPMENT, DATABASE_URL_TEST, DATABASE_URL_PREVIEW
- [ ] Frontend: REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL (NOTE: this does not process correctly with the Heroku website, so this has been hardcoded in the frontend api.js file at the top)

## Connect to database 
- [ ] Run `npx knex migrate:latest` to populate the database with tables.
- [ ] Run `npx knex seed:run` to seed data into the database.
- [ ] Run `npm run test` to run tests on the local app - data needs to be seeded with correct data before tests can pass.
